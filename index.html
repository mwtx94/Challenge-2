              My name is Michael Houston and I am from Far West Texas.</br>
              I have been out here most of my life residing in a small college town named Alpine.</br>
              I am 28 years old as of March 28, 2022.</br>
              I always told myself I wanted to get out of here when I was younger, but I have grown to like it.</br>
              Nowadays I plan on staying out here as long as possible and living a quiet peaceful life.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got my first job at 15, working part-time as a cashier for a convienence store called the "French Company."</br>
              From 17-19, I worked numerous jobs such as working at a local grocery store, construction, and dishwashing.</br>
              However, not long after I started having to watch over a disabled family member because their mental health was on a steep decline.</br>
              After about 3 or 4 years of that, they were admitted into a care facility, so I had more time to  focus on myself</br>
              With the support of my grandfather, I started working on an associates in legal support, I did not have a job, but I was extremely focused on the degree.</br>
              I ended up finishing with a 3.4 gpa June 29, 2021, which was much better than my grades in the past. I made the Dean's List 3 times and joined the Alpha Alpha Alpha honor society.</br>
              I quickly realized that there is little to no opportunity for a paralegal, which is what I was aspiring and still aspire to be.</br>
              A little discouraged, I decided to get a seasonal job at UPS, hoping to gain respect through hard work and earn a spot to stay.</br>
              I unloaded trailers every single day and did everything I could as far as emptying postal bags on the belt, organizing trucks, and sorting postal packages.</br>
              Everything was going smooth and I was actually enjoying myself, but by the end of the season, the location was informed that they could not keep any seasonal helpers.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose to take this coding bootcamp because I wanted to improve my skillset.</br>
              I knew participating in this bootcamp would be a challenge, which is what led me to enroll.</br>
              Obviously the market in this field is not getting any smaller, and I want a piece of the action.</br>
              I learned about coding through a message board, the person who made a thread on the topic of coding shared a compelling story.</br>
              He was like me and did not know what he wanted, not getting any younger. One day his friend informed him about the benefits of coding, he jumped at the opportunity.</br>
              Once I read his testimonial as to what it has done for his career, I decided to start looking up programs.</br>
              I am now 3 weeks into this bootcamp, and I must stay, it is tough, but with hardwork and focus I believe I will improve my skillset tremendously.</br>
